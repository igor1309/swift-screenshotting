# Screenshotting

A small library to create AppStore previews and screenshots.

(Optionally) use `MarketingPreview` to create App Store previews (SwiftUI views) and `screenshots` to create and save screenshots of the view for provided `devices` (device sizes) and `locales`.

SwiftUI previews are not available in test targets, so if you want to have SwiftUI previews it makes sense to create a separate target for views that would be the sources for the App Store screenshots/previews, and import that target into test target that actually produce screenshots (png-files).

See discussion in blog [Automating app screenshots and previews for the App Store with Snapshotting and fastlane | Swift and iOS dev with Igor](https://igor1309.dev/articles/2022/2022-08-20-fastlane-screenshots/).

## Installation

### üõ† Xcode

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: By default, Xcode will try to add the `Screenshotting` package to your project's main application/framework target. Please ensure that `Screenshotting` is added to the ___test___ target instead, as documented below.

1. From the menu select **File/Add Packages‚Ä¶**
2. Enter package repository URL: `https://github.com/igor1309/swift-screenshotting.git` into the search field
3. Confirm the version and let Xcode resolve the package
4. On the final dialog, make sure Screenshotting's **Add to Target** column is set to a test target that will contain screenshot tests

### üì¶ Swift Package Manager

If you want to use `Screenshotting` in any other project that uses [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the package as a dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/igor1309/swift-screenshotting.git",
        from: .init(0, 0, 1)
    )
]
```

Next, add `Screenshotting` as a dependency of your test target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyApp"),
    .testTarget(
        name: "MyAppTests",
        dependencies: [
            "MyApp",
            .product(name: "Screenshotting", package: "swift-screenshotting")
        ]
    )
]
```
